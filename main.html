  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity is a way to describe how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run as the input size grows. Writing efficient code involves minimizing the time complexity.</p>

  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. A common example is O(n), which means the memory usage grows linearly with input size.</p>
